This folder includes all hardware -schematics, layouts and BOMs for different modules of the synthesizer. 
VCO-1, VCA-1 and VCF-1 modules are (for the time being) constructed using the design and instructions 
found from http://www.birthofasynth.com/Thomas_Henry/TH_main.html. Other modules are designed by myself.
