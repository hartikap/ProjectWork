http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31321477/using-ngrok-with-websocket-or-socket-io
- ngrok tunnels also websocket connections
- encrypt the websocket-traffic!
"If unencrypted WebSocket traffic flows through an explicit or a transparent 
proxy server on its way to the WebSocket server, then, whether or not the 
proxy server behaves as it should, the connection is almost certainly bound 
to fail today (as WebSocket becomes more mainstream, proxy servers may become 
WebSocket aware). Therefore, unencrypted WebSocket connections should be used 
only in the simplest topologies."
